      _For Summer, Sophia decided to try out being a healer, while not actually giving up much in the way of her damage. She has a
      significantly higher INT stat than any other healer in the game and is an orb wielder on top, meaning she doesn't have to
      deal with the laggy staff animations that almost every other healer currently does. Her fast casts and spells mean she isn't
      that bad for wracking up hit count helping her rush gain. Her most powerful utility aspect however is her ability to be an
      AP battery, where casting certain offensive spells will grant AP to the other party members. This means she's good in just
      about any composition, though her post INT rush means she really shines with invokers. If SSophia has any weaknesses it would
      be that her actual heal is not the most potent in a pinch and may require a cancel bonus before hand._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Offensive spells restore AP to the party
      
      - Post rush buff that's powerful for self and other INT characters.
      
      - High damage. Especially for a healer.
      
      - Orb wielder, makes her less clunky and laggy compared to her staff counter parts.
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weakish heal
      
      - Lightning Wave has a max range which can make it awkward to use.
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Lightning Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (Damage Rotation. Requires 2-3 AP seed.)*
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Faerie Light Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (Damage Rotation. No AP seed.)
      
      *Faerie Light Wave > Spam it till party isn't dying. (Healing)*

      _The games starter pick for healers and a pretty terrible healer to boot, is also the worst of your five healing options. But
      if you just picked her, don't fret too much! You can re-roll! But in seriousness she is usable if weak. She's a 5 star
      non-ace which is important to keep in mind. She has less stats but is easier to max limit break. One of Miki's biggest
      issues is her lack of party buffs in her talents. In fact she's the only 5 star healer in the game who doesn't provide something
      to the party. Even the freebie 5 star of Oracle Nel does. Her party wide heal also has a massive AP cost which makes her
      awkward to use. Miki does have her strong points however. Her post rush buff is a very powerful party wide regen. Her grit talent
      to survive lethal damage also makes her quite hard to kill, which is useful in a healer especially for solo content. In summary, 
      Miki is pretty weak, but she has some strong points._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so is cheaper to max limit break and augment
      
      - Powerful post rush health regen buff for the party.
      
      - Grit talent makes her hard to kill. Making her viable for solo content
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - No talents that contribute to the party
      
      - Poor damage

      _The games first ace healer, also a rare sighting of an earth caster. Millie a healer with the ability to support dps due to her
      talents and post rush buff. Making her a significant improvement over Miki. However like most of our current healers, her damage
      is still quite low, in fact it's so bad it's best to just focus on using a normal and heal rather than actually casting 
      any damage spells, plus there are a lot of post rush elemental buffs that will over ride her talent buff in the game now as well.
      On top of that even with her AP cost reduction, her heal is still very expensive, but all her other options are bad so your 
      really taking her as a healing buff stick. In summary, Millie is a good buffer, but she is just a healing buffer so she will be
      very boring to play._

      **Cons**
      
      - Damage spells take a long time to cast making them bad
      
      - Common access to elemental damage buffs post rush that override her talent
      
      - Boring to play optimally

      _Rena is a unique healer in the fact she uses Knuckles rather than the traditional caster type weapons such as staffs and orbs.
      She also has the powerful party combat buff in Angel Feather that boosts all stats by 20%. Her cast times are also extremely 
      fast and her talents suit a melee composition very well. On top of that a 90% grit chance is insanely high, especially 
      considering her fast casting meaning she's pretty hard to kill. She does have her downsides, you can only run one of her two damage spells and they're interchangable with
      lancer providing more damage, but lasers lets you complete rotations with faerie light faster. She has pretty slow rush gain
      especially if she's struggling to hit with her damage spells, and her melee normals make playing her a little awkward. In
      summary Rena is the best true healer we have right now, fast cast times, a strong buff, good healing output. But her low damage
      and slow rush gain leave something to be desire._

      _Oracle Nel is a free welfare 5 star unit. She just manages to edge out Miki as the worst 5 star healer in the game, but Tearful
      Welch came along to take her title as worst free unit. Oracle Nel is still usable and isn't a pure grief character. She offers
      a weak damage buff to the party, her repel talent helps her avoid taking aggro and her movement boost also helps her stay out of
      trouble. She's also an ice caster which is rare and her rush doesn't deal terrible damage. Ice Needles is also a decent filler
      spell which has homing so it'll actually hit the target helping rush gain. Her down sides, however are many. No AP or cast time
      reduction means her healing is expensive and slow. Her post rush buff is not party wide and while it improves her damage you
      aren't bringing a healer for their personal dps. Her stats are also quite weak, having very low INT due to the lack of a self
      INT buff. In summary, she makes for a character that needs to be carried, will be nice to have her if you fancy a welfare
      character run in harder content as the designated healer._

      _Evelysse isn't some useless poster girl who looks good and orders you around. She decides to get stuck in. She also happens to
      be the first character that has had buffs compared to their JP version counterpart. The reduction of cast times by 20% and the
      20% reduction to her rush gauge or global exclusive buffs. These buffs however aren't enough to make Eve outstanding and they
      still err on the side of caution with Evelysse. Her unique post rush ability to revive the party is very powerful, but the lack
      of ability to get to use it, and the fact that as a healer you should be trying to prevent deaths, don't really do much to make
      Eve a must pick. She also has long cast times even with the reduction so you have to pick your spells. Lancer is the best filler
      spell she has, but an enemy that likes moving makes conjure comet's ability to home very useful. If they ever fix the fact it
      crashes people on normal quality graphics settings. In all Evelysse is usable but not incredible, she brings some party buffs 
      that are on the weak side but not common in overlap currently. If you want to use her though, by all means do, just know it
      might be challenging in harder content._

      _Sarah enters the game as the latest non-ace 5 star that you can pull. The benefit to her is that this makes her one of the
      better 5 stars to pull and invest in. Sarah is a budget Rena who supports a long range team over a melee composition, on top of
      that she gains the powerful Angel Feather buff just like Rena and a grit talent with a high trigger chance, just like Rena.
      Extra benefits she brings is that she grans immunity to and cleanses poison and paralysis, making her a great pick if you're
      just looking for a healer for MoT ass she has the attributes to be good for solo content, plus means you don't need to use 4
      star characters and invest in them. However while she shares many positives with our best permanent ace healer right now, she has
      many more negatives. She lacks both AP cost reduction and faster cast times, couple that with being a staff user it means her
      spells are both expensiveand slow, especially her party healing. She also lacks a self INT buff, giving her the lowest INT out
      of any of the permanent healers, the only healer with less is the freebie Oracle Nel. Her lack of AP reduction means Angel Feather
      in particular is very expensive to use which slows her rush gain right down, meaning that 3 person rushes will be common with 
      a Sarah in your group. In summary Sarah is a significant improvement on Miki, and worth considering if you want a healer for
      your MoT team, but if you're looking to play a healer in M2 or M3 content it may be best to look elsewhere._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so is cheaper to max limit break and augment
      
      - Immunity to Poison and Paralysis. Cleansing of them post rush.
      
      - Grit talent makes her hard to kill.
      
      - Angel Feather
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Slow rush gain
      
      - Poor damage
      
      - Expensive healing

      _Precis decides that before showing up as a permanent character, she'll join to add some Christmas cheer to your party. Winter
      Precis is very comparable to Summer Sophia as both are AP batteries who provide AP to the party when they cast an offensive 
      spell. Precis also provides mobility buffs to the party, only overlapping with 9S currently. Her symbology reduction time is also
      party wide making her a good option for invoker comps as her cast time reduction is better than many characters self cast time 
      reduction buffs. Her best attributes lie in her hit counter buffs, which buff both critical hit rate and critical hit damage, 
      which also helps make her the best character to bring to Crystal Guadian if everyone wants to auto. On top of all that she also
      extends the hit count timer by two seconds which means she really helps bring hit count compositions together. This means she
      has fantastic synergy with both the winter and halloween characters. Her post rush buff also keeps that critical hit rate where
      it was even after losing your hit counter and she provides a regen health buff, allowing her to focus on damage post rush as 
      regen provides the sustain. She still has her weaknesses, being a staff wielder being one of them as the animations are still
      an issue. Also she has no homing attack and because Lancer which has most of its damage on the last hit, and rays has most of
      its damage on the initial hit, meaning that bosses that like to move a lot such as Jie can provide a real problem for her damage
      output. In summary Winter Precis is one of the best healers you can run with right now, she works with any composition but really
      shines with her fellow hit count lovers._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Movement buffing talents.
      
      - Grants AP to the party when using offensive spells.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction for the party.
      
      - Powerful hit count buffs.
      
      - Strong post rush buffs.
      
      - Hit count timer extension gives good synergy with hit count characters.
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Staff animations
      
      - Struggles against fast moving targets
      
      - Lack of AP reduction talent
      
      - Lack of talent to help surviability

      _Relia joins the fray and shows us how merciless the Captain and Eve are in sending a small child into battle. Relia is an
      interesting healer. Her damage is quite lacklustre but she offers combat buffs both in a set skill and in her party wide heal,
      adding extra value to her heal and making you feel less bad about spamming it for rush gain. Her party wide talents also have
      synergy, as the passive heal helps top up any chips damage taken, meaning she works well with any character with 100% hp talents.
      Her post rush buff also increases single target damage and adds a powerful health regen buff. This whole package means that Relia
      makes a very good "true" healer who's good at keeping the party alive. Of course like any staff wielder, animations are an issue
      even with her invoking time buff, she also lacks damage and neither of her offensive spells are fantastic. She also has no
      AP reduction making spells quite expensive to use. Plus she lacks any strong personal surviability talent making her quite
      squishy. In summary, Relia is a fantastic healer if you want to play a character who lives up to the role. She both heals and
      buffs while lacking much punch. An interesting character to play if you're a healer main._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Brute Englightenment to buff INT and reduce ATK damage taken.
      
      - Party wide heal with a 20% ATK buff baked in.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction.
      
      - Strong post rush buffs.
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Staff animations.
      
      - Low damage.
      
      - Lack of AP reduction talent.
      
      - Lack of talent to help surviability.
      
      - Certain compositions with certain bosses make Brute Enlightenment a dead skill.
